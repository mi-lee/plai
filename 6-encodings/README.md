lambda calculus: (1) variables, (2) function definitions and (3) function applications => Turing-complete language.

any Turing-complete language can be expressed by lambda calculus.

Desugaring to an extreme =>

`with*`, `if*` => idiomatic Racket to represent...?? TODO

`let*`: with with multiple bindings ==> state is threaded (next with statement can refer to variable bound in previous with statement).
