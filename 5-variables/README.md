# Variables

Motivation: ability to mutate variables (to work like boxes in that regard)



Variables and boxes:

The point of having references is to update variables in place.

### Example:

Variables and boxes -- boxes are like pointers in C (location with variable as identifier). Allowing mutations to be observabale -- can you

- boxes/pointers
- every assignment can change the value

Go: assignment is a copy



tldr: boxes are not any more fundamental than variables.

RVCFAE: every function application is by reference.
