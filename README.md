# Programming Languages (CS 5510)

My Racket files from Matthew Flatt's [CS 5510: Definition of Programming Languages](https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs5510/index.html). They use [plai](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/index.html), not [plai-typed](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plai-typed/index.html) as he does in his course. It closely follows Shriram Krishnamurthi's [Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/).
